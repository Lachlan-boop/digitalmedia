                <li><span>Causes:</span>There is a large list of causes to the global issue of air pollution, these will be natural or manmade, indoor or outdoor and widespread or localized. The problem is largely contributed to by the doings of all humans.</li>
                <li>
                    <span>Fossil fuels: </span>Fossil fuels, otherwise known as hydrocarbons, consist of things such as coal, oil fuel and natural gasses formed by the remains of dead animals and plants. Our utilization of these fuels has granted us with many necessities in our everyday life such as transport (cars, trucks, trains, aeroplanes, etc.), manufacturing industries, heat for our homes and most importantly it provides us with electricity. In 2018, the United States obtained an enormous 81% of its total energy from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels fall under the resource category of ‘non-renewable resources’ which means they cannot be replaced by their natural rate equal to their rate of consumption. They are getting used far too quickly and we will soon have to slow down the rate at which we use them. When these fossil fuels are burned/combusted, they release nitrogen oxides into the earth’s atmosphere, therefore depleting the air quality. This is the primary cause to air pollution but there is also a vast list of others.</li>
                <li><span>Wild fires:</span> With the rising temperature of the earth, the climate has become drier and this is increasing the risk of wild fires. Only last month, the Nelson region in New Zealand, experienced some of the worst fires its seen in years. Air quality is adversely affected by wild fires, as it is by fires that are planned, during programmed burning of land areas. Huge amounts of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds are released into the atmosphere, during a fire, along with components such as nitrogen oxides that create ozone, and lots of organic debris. Some of those most directly affected are the firefighters who are the first to respond in trying to control wildfires and the residents whose homes are at risk from the rapidly spreading fires. Because the wind can carry many of the pollutants arising from the fires, areas far beyond the extent of the wild fire can be affected, and when it rains, many of the pollutants in the air are returned to the surface of the earth where they will cause harm.</li>
                
                <li><span>Volcanoes: </span> When volcanoes erupt, they expel a vast range of gasses and particles. Some of these gasses such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), which when combined with air, will form sulfuric acid which both directly affects the quality of air but also directly impacts the environment.</li>
                
                <li><span>Industrial Manufacturing Factories: </span> The vast majority of people in this world rely in manufacturing companies for almost everything. Although, what a lot of people don’t know is that they are a large. contributing factor to air pollution. They directly impact air quality by spewing ginormous amounts of harmful chemicals into the air and have been doing so since the beginning of the industrial age.</li>
 
<li>In the United States, the Factories have power that comes from fossil fuel burning power plants (along with the 81% of total energy from the U.S.). The creation of the power for the factories causes greater air pollution than the direct factory utilisation. </li>

<li>Components for the machines are made from metals silica and metallic dusts when they are crushed and ground. When the metals are smelted, it produces sulfur and carbon oxide emissions. Aluminium smelting can produce arsenic particles while lead and gold smelting can produce mercury and cyanide emissions.

            <ol style="list-style-type:none";>
                <li><span>Respiration:</span>Particulate matter (PM) is a very complex mixture of extremely small particles which may contain smoke, soot, nitrates, metals, dust, sulfates and tyre rubber. PM can be released as smoke from a fire or from chemical reactions in the atmosphere like nitrogen oxides. Because a large amount of PM is so fine, it can be directly linked with health problems as it is able to bypass the body’s defense system and straight into the lungs. Persistent exposure to air with an abnormally high concentration of these particles can lead to respiratory problems in the lungs and heart. Some more significant problems include irritation of the airways in the lungs, coughing, difficulty breathing, reduced lung function, intensified asthma, chronic respiratory diseases (bronchitis, obstructive lung disease), irregular heartbeats, heart attacks and even premature deaths for people with lung cancer or heart disease.   </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Acid Rain: </span>When rain clouds are formed, they are not always made up of pure water. Chemical reactions, coming from the burning of fossil fuels and volcanoes, can take place that cause not only the air quality to decrease but also decrease the pH in the rain, therefore making it acidic giving it the label ‘acid rain’. The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide while in the rain have not been observed to have a large effect on the health of humans, they do have impacts on other wild life and plants. The ecological effects of acid rain are most clearly seen in aquatic environments such as streams, rivers and lakes where the acidity can be harmful to fish and other wild life. It can also become harmful to trees and plants when the acid rain seeps through soil to the plant’s roots.</li>
                <li><span>Global Warming:</span>
The planet is currently warming at a much higher rate than what it should be because of additional greenhouse gases getting released into the atmosphere by air pollution. When fuels and trees are burned, some of the gases released into the air are greenhouses gases. Through the method of photosynthesis, plants will convert carbon dioxide to oxygen, using the carbon to grow larger but the amount of carbon dioxide released by humans is much more than plants can convert. This carbon dioxide, along with some other greenhouse gases, form a blanket around the earth keeping some of the heat from the Sun from escaping, therefore cause the atmosphere to accumulate heat.</li>
<li>Global warming is triggering changes to plant’s and animal’s habitats around the world. In places such as Antarctica, Greenland and Canada, polar ice caps and glaciers are melting. This impacts the habitat and resources for any organisms living there. Warming oceans, rising sea levels, overflow, and coral diseases are impacting shallow aquatic environments such as coral reefs. Global warming is leading to less rain falling in the middle of continents. This causes these areas to be very dry and limits water resources for organisms.

                <li><span>Urban eye allergy: </span> Air pollution is not only bad for breathing, researchers have found out that it’s bad for the
eyes, too. Doctors have created a new phrase ‘urban eye allergy’ that affects the surface of
the eye and it’s largely because of pollution in urban areas. Patients complain of sore eyes,
that are gritty and uncomfortable, affecting quality of life and their ability to work. Pollen
grains that normally can cause a hayfever reaction, are becoming more allergenic because
of air pollution, and are having a much more toxic effect on the eyes.
