                <li><span>Solutions:</span>Although air pollution is one of the biggest threats to the environment and one of the biggest contributing factors to global warming, it is also an avoidable issue if we start doing something about it. There are multiple solutions to this problem. 
The most obvious solution would have to be renewable energy and clean energy production. This would mean moving away from fossil fuels as a source of electricity and drift closer to renewable sources of electricity. Fossil fuels are a major cause of air pollution so the more we can swerve in the opposite direction of them with things like wind farms, water turbines and solar panels, the faster we can resolve the issue. All of these clean energy producers use what we already have in the world like wind, water and sun to produce electricity. Renewable energy has already made an impact on the world, because around a quarter of the worldâ€™s energy comes from renewable sources.
</li>
                <li>
                    <span>Reduce Carbon emmisions: </span>Another good solution to reduce our carbon emissions is eco-friendly transportation. Again, fossil fuels are adverly affecting the environment and also take thousands of years to reform, which is why eliminating the use of them in our transportation is a very important step towards cleaner air. Using oil and petroleum to power engines for cars, trucks and planes leaves an enormous carbon footprint whereas using cars that run on electricity or hydrogen leave nothing (so long as renewable energy is used to power an electric car).</li>
                <li><span>Global warming:</span>As far as climate change and global warming go, there solutions are still pretty simple like encouraging better use of natural resources, stopping deforestation, planting trees, recycling and adopting responsible consumption habits. Chlorofluorocarbon otherwise known as CFCs, are air pollutants that destroy the ozone layer in the atmosphere. They were usually found in aerosols before a ban on all CFC aerosols took place. Since then the ozone layer has started to reform and become better at protecting Antarctica (and New Zealand) from ultraviolet radiation.</li>
                
                <li><span>Reduce, reuse, recycle: </span> One of the best things we can do to resolve the effects of air pollution is to put the reduce, reuse, recycle rule to practice. This is perfect because it is so easy and simple for everyone in the world to do because everyone needs to do their part and lots of small things will eventually build up into something larger. The other solutions sound like a nice idea but are always so much easier said the done. It would be expensive for people to buy solar panel and electric cars. Also, making almost everything for clean energy production and eco-friendly transport such as wind turbines, cars and solar panels are all made from a large amount of metal which has to be smelted. The smelting process releases toxic air pollutants like sulfur and carbon oxides.</li>
